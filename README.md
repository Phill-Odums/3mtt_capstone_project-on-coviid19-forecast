Demographic Factors:

Population Density: Areas with higher population densities showed a tendency for higher daily growth rates. This aligns with the understanding that close-contact settings facilitate faster viral transmission.
Age Distribution: Regions with older populations experienced more severe outcomes, as older adults are at higher risk of complications, which may contribute indirectly to higher growth rates through delayed reporting and higher hospitalization rates.
Environmental Factors:

Temperature and Humidity: The data suggests a potential correlation between daily growth rates and specific environmental conditions, such as low temperatures and humidity levels, which may enhance viral stability and transmission.
Air Quality: Poor air quality may exacerbate respiratory conditions, increasing susceptibility to severe COVID-19 cases and influencing growth rates in affected regions.
Healthcare Access:

Regions with inadequate healthcare infrastructure showed higher daily growth rates, potentially due to delayed testing, reporting, and limited capacity to implement mitigation measures effectively.
